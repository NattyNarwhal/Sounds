A minimalistic music player for Windows.

* Written in C#
* No skins, no plugins, no funny business
* A simple UI that attempts to be a model citizen on the platform
* Uses TagLib for parsing metadata, uses native support in Windows for playback.
  * This means that you need to install codecs for things like FLAC support on pre-Windows 10.
