You are free - and encouraged - to reuse this code in any way that you like, including closed source and commercial products, without giving credit.

Suggested usage:
As with foobar2000, most of desktop Windows apps are built with toolchain and SDK that targets older Windows versions, such as from Windows XP up.
Use of this code in a DLL allows just the DLL to be compiled with Windows 10 SDK, so it can be utilized without compiling your entire app for Windows 10.

Functionaltiy:
Currently, PP-UWP-Interop only interacts with Windows 10 Universal Volume Control.
